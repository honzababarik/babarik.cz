        description: `After relocating to San Francisco in 2016 to work closer with our core TripIt platform development team, I joined the delivery team responsible for TripIt paid features. Together, we lead the reintroduction of our second paid business product - TripIt for Teams.

          One of the biggest ongoing projects was moving TripIt from monolith towards SOA using Python/NodeJS microservices, plunging me into a world of new AWS technologies like ECS, VPC, Aurora, EC2, S3, Elasticache, CloudFormation, Route53 and many more. I learned a ton, and developed experience in DevOps using AWS.
          Proof of concept for SOA was a feature called GoNow, which I designed, architected, led the team to develop, and rolled out. GoNow became the most covered TripIt feature online in TripItâ€™s history.

          In 2018 TripIt engineering focused on GDPR compliance and our data security, which helped me to understand more advanced security concepts for enterprise systems.

          With big plans for TripIt to globalize in 2019, my team owns all of the localization efforts of our platform that was originally built without any internalization support. Some highlights of my time here are...

          In the beginning next to learning about TripIt platform and its codebase I spent time interviewing engineers to grow our new engineering team to over a dozen engineers.

          As TripIt grew, the platform technology became obsolete. Together with other platform engineers we started to define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to break down the TripIt monolith into microservices, and to come up with best practices to be adopted by the rest of our Prague and San Francisco team.

          Later in 2015 I have switched roles from a full-stack platform engineer to lead Concur's remote team responsible for development of Objective-C based iOS app called ExpenseIt - an app to help employees manage their business related expenses with ease.

          Beacoin was my own idea that I got after starting trading crypto currencies. The problem with signal trading was that there were a lot of signal traders (people who tell you what to buy/sell and when) that were manipulating the numbers of how successful their trading strategies are, luring the users to buy their questionable product.

          Beacoin is both web and mobile app that is used by signal traders to easily send their paid clients the signal information without being able to manipulate their history. For users that means transparency and ease of use - you get a signal to buy Bitcoin, click on the Buy button and Beacoin's integration to the biggest crypto exchanges takes care of the rest.

          Beacoin is hosted on AWS in US and EU, and I have architected and built the web, opened REST API and mobile app for iOS and Android using React Native myself.
